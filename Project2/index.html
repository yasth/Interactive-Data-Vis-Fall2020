        <p>While it may not directly seem to require a degree, audience members without a four year college degree are not likely 
          to find any representation in speakers on the news. Some of this can of course be explained in that experts are rarely 
          going to lack a degree of some sort. Still it is worth noting that over 60% of the population over 25 lacks a 4 year degree,
          and they see very little representation in the media.
        </p>
        <p>Looking at the per network break downs, it is clear that certain networks had differing approaches, CNN had a number of 
          people with JDs (though that may have been driven by the news of the day), while Fox had far more Bachelors Degrees. 
          NPR and MSNBC both had a large number of speakers with Masters degrees.

    <h2>Selectivity of Education</h2>
    <p>While it is often underrepresented in demographic breakdowns, most people recognize that there is a difference between an Ivy league school and say the University of Colorado.
      Educational quality may be debated, but the University of Colorado is certainly less restrictive of its student body. 
      If you went to an undergraduate college, you are encouraged to look up the acceptance rate, as it may be surprising. Few would suspect that
      the University of Maine at 92% would over be four times less restrictive than the University of Michigan at 22%.

      <p>It is immediately obvious that there is a strong bias towards more selective schools. The data presented actually rather 
        understates the case as the best national data availible groups all schools with an under 50% acceptance rate together. 
        Many of the acceptance rates for media speakers were in fact much lower than this cut off. 
      </p>
      <p>On MSNBC in our sample there was not a single speaker who went to a anything other than the most selective of schools for undergraduate. 
        This is strikingly unlike the US population at large. PBS was almost as restrictive, but had some variation. NPR had more in the somewhat 
        less selective band, though the majority was still the most selective. Only Fox News has a majority outside of the most selective schools.
        Fox News is also interesting as their second most popular band is of relatively permisive selectivity (71-85%).

        In determining class in the United States economists and sociologists often simply use income and education. This is mostly for ease 
        of information gathering. Few would say that a person who got a Bachelor's degree in Nursing from SUNY Polytechnic College 69% was really in
        the same socioeconomic class as someone who got a Bachelor's from Harvard College (4.7%), even if they both are economically and educational 
        attainment wise the same. To put it bluntly they probably go to different parties, and read different books.
